## Project Overview

BlogApp is designed to allow users to write and manage blog posts with an intuitive interface. It is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application where the backend provides APIs for blog management, and the frontend offers a user-friendly interface for blog interactions.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) blog posts.
- Responsive user interface.
- RESTful API for backend operations.
- MongoDB for data storage.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- React.js (JavaScript library)
- Redux Toolkit (for state management)
- React Router DOM (for routing)
- HTML/CSS (for layout and design)

### Backend:
- Node.js (JavaScript runtime)
- Express.js (backend framework)
- MongoDB (NoSQL database)
- Mongoose (for MongoDB object modeling)
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- dotenv (for environment variables)
